# linux-webtop

Write your linux bar and desktop background in Javascript! Sure, it's not as lightweight as lemonbar, but hey, computers are *fast* now, and dammit I don't know bash well enough to configure lemonbar on my lonesome (at least, not as well as people on /r/unixporn do)

## How to use

The bar portion mounts `$HOME/.webtop/bar/dist/index.html`. The desktop portion will mount `$HOME/.webtop/desktop/dist/index.html`. These paths can be overwritten in `~/.webtop/config.json`, where you can override any config value found in `config-default.json`. Please note that file paths in your config will not expand shell expressions, substitute environment variables, or do anything else you might expect them to do in a regular shell script. They are javascript strings, and I just add a little special handling if they start with `~`.

 Feel free to use whatever technology or front end framework you wish, just set your compiler to generate a file at the correct location. Personally, I'm planning on using Vue with Webpack.
